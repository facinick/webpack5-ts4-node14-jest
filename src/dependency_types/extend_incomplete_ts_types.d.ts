/**********************************************************************
There are times when the TypeScript SDK does not include definitions 
for a property or function already supported by some browsers. In this 
example itâ€™s the function array.includes() which is missing. If you 
face this scenario where the missing definition is part of the basic 
TypeScript definitions, and not a part of a library, all you need to 
do is re-declare the interface and add the missing property.

interface Array<T> {
    includes: (item: T, fromIndex?: number) => boolean;
}

interface Window {
    customProperty: boolean;
}
